# A World Without Strings is Chaos - solutions in various languages
Programming exercises on strings in J

I'm interested in array languages (APL/J/K/Nial...). While searching the Internet for resources on K I stumbled upon some programming exercises on strings by John Earnest:

[A World Without Strings is Chaos](http://beyondloom.com/blog/strings.html)

After I solved them in K (oK/Kona), I decided to solve them using other languages I know or I am currenlty learning. I'll be collecting the results here.


* K ([oK](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/ok) / [Kona](https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona))
* [J](https://www.jsoftware.com/#/README)

* [Factor](https://factorcode.org/)
